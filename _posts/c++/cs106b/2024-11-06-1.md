## abstration

### defination

Design that hides the details of how something works while still allowing the user to access complex functionality

### what is an abstraction

Key idea:Through a simpler interface, users are able to take full advantage of a complex system without needing to know how it works or how it was made.

## includes

### angle bracket

use of the angle bracket operators is usually reserved for code from the C++ Standard library

### quote

use of the quotes is usually reserved for code from the Stanford C++ libraries, or code in files that you have written yourself

## variables and types

### variables

A way for code to store information by associating a value with a name  <br />
we will think of a variable as a named container storing a value 

### types

All variables have a type associated with them, where the type describes the representation of the variable. <br />
In C++,all types must be explicitly defined when the variable is created, and a variable cannot change its type.

## funtion

### anatomy of a function

![function](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/function.png)

```
definition:
parameter(s):
one or more variables that your function expects as input.

argument(s):
the values passed into your function and assigned to its parameter variables.

return value:
the value that your function hands back to the "calling" function.
```
<font color=blue>can think parameters as a special set of local variables that belong to a function</font>

```
returnType functionName(varType parameter1, varType parameter2, ...){
    returnType variable = /* Some fancy code */
    /* more code */
    return variable;
}
```
<font color=blue>a function must always be defined before it is called</font>

Pass-by-value is the default mode of operation when it comes to parameters in C++,which means that parameter is passed to function by value,variable is a copy of the variable passed in,changing it inside the function does not change the value in the calling function.

```
defenition:
pass by value:When a parameter is passed into a function, the new variable stores a copy of the passed in value in memory.
pass by reference:When a parameter is passed into a function, the new variable stores a reference to the passed in value, which allows you to directly edit the original value.
```

### When we use references
* To allow helper functions to edit data stuctures in other functions
* To avoid making new copies of large data structures in memory
* References also provide a workaround for multiple return values
    - Your function can both have a return value and also directly edit a Vector object passed in as a parameter.This makes it as if your function is returning both the vector and the actual return value
  
### When we don't use references
* If we always used references,functions would all be able to edit one another's variables, and scoping would get confusing
* When the data itself is small(i.e. the cost of copying by value is low)
* Note: You can't provide a literal as an argument if you are passing a parameter by reference.

## Âæ™ÁéØ‰ªÄ‰πàÁöÑ‰∏çÊÉ≥ËÆ∞ÔºàÁò´

## string

* Strings are mutable in C++
* You can add characters to strings and strings to strings using += and +
    - Strings must use double quotes("")while characters use single('')
* You can use logical operators to compare strings(and characters)(only comparing the first letter)

when running 
```
string hiThere = "hi"+"there";
```
you would get <font color=red>a error</font> <br />
cause there are cpp string and c string in cpp,when declare a string like "hi" you would get a c string,which is not allowed to be added together. <br />

when running
```
string hiThere = "hi"+'!';
```
you would get <font color=red>a garbage</font> <br />
cause when add a different type to a c string, it would point to random garbage.

### C strings vs C++ strings summary
* C strings have no methods
    - This is why you can't do something like "hi".length() in C++
* Conversion fixes
    - Store the C string in a variable first to convert it to a C++ string
    - Use a conversion function
      - string("text"); // converts the C string literal into a C++ string
      - strig.c_str(); // return a C string from a C++ string <br />

Takeaway:Beware of C string

## Abstract Data Types

### Vector

* At a high level,a vector is an ordered collection of elements of the same type that can grow and shrink in size.
  - Each element in the collection has a specific location, or index
  - All elements in a vector must be of the same type.Unlike in other programming languages, a single vector cannot contain elements of mixed types.
  - Vectors are fixible when it comes to the number of elements they can store.You can easily add and remove elements from a vector.Vectors also know their size, meaning you can query them to see how many elements they currently contain.

### Grid(In Stanford library)

![grid](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/grid.png)
* A 2D array, defined with a particular width and height
  - we say array instead of vector here because the dimensions are established when the grid is created
* useful for spreadsheets,game boards,etc
* Three ways to declare a grid
  - Grid<type> gridName;
    ```
    Grid<int> board; \\ if you declare a board with no initialization,you must resize it or reassign it before using it.Resizing will fill it with default values for that type.
    board.resize(3,3);
    board[0][0] = 2;
    ```
  - Grid<type> gridName(numRows,numCols);
    ```
    Grid<int> board(3,3);
    ```
  - Grid<type> gridName = {{r0c0,r0c1,r0c2},{r1c0,r1c1,r1c2},...};
    ```
    Grid<int> board = {{2,0},{6,0}};
* We could use a combination of Vectors to simulate a 2D matrix,but a Grid is easier

### Tradeoffs with vectors and grids(vs. other ADTs)
* Easily able to search through all elements
* Can use the indices as a way of structuring the data

### Struct

A way to bundle different types of information in C++,like creating a custom data structure.
* To declare a struct,you can either assign each of its members separately or assign it when it's created

### Queue

* First person In is the First person Out(FIFO)
  - When you remove(dequeue)people from the queue, you remove them from the front of the line
* Last person in is the last person served
  - When you insert(enqueue)people into a queue, you insert them at the back(the end of the line)

### Stack

![stack](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/stack.png)
* Modeled like an actual pancakesü•û
* Only the top element in a stack is accessible
  - The Last item In is the First one Out(LIFO)
* The push, pop, and top operations are the only operations allowed by the stack ADT

Common bugs: <br />
* If you edit the ADT within a loop,don't use .size() in the loop's conditions!The size changes while the loop runs.
* Unlike with queues,you can't iterate over a stack without destroying it

### Tradeoffs with queues and stacks(vs. other ADTs)

* What are some downsides to using a queue/stack?
  - No random access.You get the front/top,or nothing.
  - No side-effect-free traversal -- you can only iterate over all elements in the structure by removing previous elements first.
  - No easy way to search through a queue/stack
* What are some benefits?
  - Useful for lots of problem -- many real-world problems can be solved with either a LIFO or FIFO model
  - Very easy to build one from array such that access is guaranteed to be fast.

### Set

* A set is a collection of elements with no duplicates
* Sets are faster than ordered data structures like vectors -- since there are no duplicate, it's faster for them to find things
* Sets don't have indices

#### Set operands

Sets can be compared,combined,etc.
* s1 == s2 <br/>
  true if the sets contain exactly the same elements
* s1 != s2 <br/>
  true if the sets don't contain the exact same elements
* s1 + s2 <br/>
  returns the union of s1 and s2(i.e.,all elements in both)
* s1 * s2 <br/>
  return the intersection of s1 and s2(i.e.,only the elements in both sets)
* s1 - s2 <br/>
  returns the different of s1 and s2(the elemenets in s1 but not in s2)

#### Common Set patterns and pitfalls

* Use for each loops to iterate over sets
  ```
  for(type currElem : set){
    // process elements one at a time
  }
* You cannot use anything that attempts to index into the set(e.g.for(int i = 0; .. ) or set[i])

### Map

![map](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/map.png)
* A map is a collection of key/value pairs, and the key is used to quickly find the value
* A map is an alternative to ordered data structure, where the "indices" no longer need to be integers.
  
#### Map example(Using Stanford library)

```
// maps from string keys to string values
Map<string, string> phoneBook;

//          key         value
phoneBook["Jenny"] = "867-5309"; //or
phoneBook.put("Jenny", "867-5309");

string jennyNumber = phoneBook["Jenny"]; // or
string jennyNumber = phoneBook.get("Jenny");
cout << jennyNumber << endl;

// maps from string keys to Vector<double> values
Map<string, Vector<double>> accounts;
```

#### Common Map patterns and pitfalls

* Use for each loops to iterate over maps
  ```
  for (type curKey : map){
    // see map values using map[curKey]
  }
  ```
  Don't remove keys within the loop as you're iterating

  ```
  for (type curKey : map.keys()){
    // see map values using map[curKey]
  }
  ```
  Okay to edit map within this loop because .values()/.keys() makes a Vector copy of the values/keys.
* How to check whether the key is in the map:
  ```
  Map<string, int> freqMap;
  ...
  // get key to test if it's in the map
  if (freqMap.containsKey(key)){
    cout << key << " is in the map" << endl;
  }
  ```

## Breadth-First Search(BFS)

### Data Structures
* A data structue to represent(partial word)ladders
  - Stack<string>
* A data structure to store all the partial word ladders that we have generated so far and have yets to explore
  - Queue<Stack<string>>
* A data structure to keep track of all the words that we've explored so far, so that we avoid getting stuck in loops
  - Set<string>

### Pseudocode

Create an empty queue and an empty set of visited locations <br/>
Create an initial word ladder containing the starting word and add it to the queue <br/>
While the queue is not empty <br/>
&emsp;Remove the next partial ladder from the queue <br/>
&emsp;Set the current search word to be the word at the top of the ladder <br/>
&emsp;If the current word is the destination, then return the current ladder <br/>
&emsp;Generate all "neighboring" words that are valid English words and one letter away from the current word <br/>
&emsp;Loop over all neighbor words <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;If the neighbor hasn't been visited <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Create a copy of the current ladder <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Add the neighbor to the top of the new ladder and mark it visited <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Add the new ladder to the back of the queue of partial ladders

## Big-O Notation and Algorithmic Analysis

### Nested Data StructuresÔºàÂµåÂ•óÊï∞ÊçÆÁªìÊûÑÔºâ

Nesting data structures(using one ADTs as the data type inside of another ADT)is a great way of organizing data with complex structure

#### example

![20241110163247](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/20241110163247.png)
![20241110163601](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/20241110163601.png)
![20241110163713](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/20241110163713.png)

#### Summary 

* Powerful
  - Can express highly structured and complex data
  - Used in many real-world systems
* Tricky
  - With increased complexity comes increased cognitive load in differentiating between the levels of information stored at each level of the Nesting
  - Specially in cpp, working with nested data structures can be tricky due to the fact that references and copies show up at different points in time.

### Big-O Noatation

* Big-O notation is a way of quantifying the rate at which quantity grows.
* Example:
  - A square of side length r has area O($r^2$)
  - A circle of radius r has area O($r^2$)
  - <font color=red>the $r^2$ just says that these quantities grow at the same relative rates.It does not say that they are equal.</font>

#### Example 

Manufacturing <br/>
You're working at a compony producing cat toys.It costs you some amount of money to produce a cat toy, and there was some one-time cost to set-up the factory. <br/>
What data would you need to gather to estimate the cost of producing ten million cat toys? <br/>

cost(n) = n * costPerWidget(This term grows as a function of n) + startupCost(This term does not grow)
        = O(n)

#### Nuances of Big-O

* Big-O notation is designed to capture the rate at which a quantity grows.It does not capture information about
  - leading coefficients: the area of a square and a circle are both O($r^2$)
  - lower-order terms: there may be other factors contributing to growth that get glossed over
* However,it's still a very powerful tool for predicting behavior

#### Why runtime isn't enough?

* What is runtime?
  - Runtime is simply the amount of real time it takes for a program to run 
* Measuring wall-clock runtime is less than ideal, since
  - It depends on what computer you're using,
  - What else is running on that computer,
  - Whether that computer is conserving power,
  - etc
* Worse, individual runtimes can't predict future runtimes

#### Analyze

```
int vectorMax(Vector<int> &v){ // 1 time unit
  int currentMax = v[0];       // 1 time unit
  int n = v.size();            // 1 time unit
  for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){  // (N+1)time units
    if(currentMax < v[i]){     // N time units
      currentMax = v[i];       // N time units
    }                          // (up to)N time units
  }                            // 1 time unit
  return currentMax;
} 
// doubling the size of the input roughly doubles the runtime.Therefore, the input and runtime have a linear(O(N))relationship. 
```

### Recursion

#### definition

A problem-solving technique in which tasks are completed by reducing them into repeated, smaller tasks of the same form.

#### Two main cases (components) of recursion 

* Base case 
  - The simplest version(s) of your problem that all other cases reduce to
  - An occurrance that can be answered directly
* Recursive case
  - The step at which you break down more complex versions of the task into smaller occurrances
  - Cannot be answered directly
  - Take the "recursive leap of faith" and trust the smaller tasks will solve the problem for you

#### Stack Frame

gets created each time a function is called. <br/>
- The "stack" is where in your computer's memory the information is created.
- A "frame" stores all of the data(variables)for that particular function call.

#### Approaching recursive problems

* Look for self-similarity(An object is self-similar if it contains a smaller copy of itself)
* Try out an example
  - Work through a simple example and then increase the complexity
  - Think about what information needs to be "stored" at each step in the recursive case
* Ask yourself:
  - What is the base case?(What is the simplest case?)
  - What is the recursive case?(What pattern of self-similarity do you see?)

##### How can we reserve a string

![20241111211027](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/20241111211027.png)

#### Summary

* Recursion is a problem-solving technique in which tasks are completed by reducing them into repeated,smaller tasks of the same form
* Recursion has two main parts: the base case and the recursive case
* The solution will get built up as you come back up the call stack
  - The base case will define the "base" of the solution you're building up.
  - Each previous recursive call contributes a little bit to the final solution
  - The initial call to your recursive function is what will return the completely constructed answer.

#### Fractals

* A fractal is any repeated, graphical pattern
* A fractal is composed of repeated instances of the same shape or pattern, arranged in a structured way
* Fractals and self-similar structures are often difined in terms of some parameter called the order, which indicates the complexity of the overall structure.
