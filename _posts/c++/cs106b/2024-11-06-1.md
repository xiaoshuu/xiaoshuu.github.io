## abstration

### defination

Design that hides the details of how something works while still allowing the user to access complex functionality

### what is an abstraction

Key idea:Through a simpler interface, users are able to take full advantage of a complex system without needing to know how it works or how it was made.

## includes

### angle bracket

use of the angle bracket operators is usually reserved for code from the C++ Standard library

### quote

use of the quotes is usually reserved for code from the Stanford C++ libraries, or code in files that you have written yourself

## variables and types

### variables

A way for code to store information by associating a value with a name  <br />
we will think of a variable as a named container storing a value 

### types

All variables have a type associated with them, where the type describes the representation of the variable. <br />
In C++,all types must be explicitly defined when the variable is created, and a variable cannot change its type.

## funtion

### anatomy of a function

![function](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/function.png)

```
definition:
parameter(s):
one or more variables that your function expects as input.

argument(s):
the values passed into your function and assigned to its parameter variables.

return value:
the value that your function hands back to the "calling" function.
```
<font color=blue>can think parameters as a special set of local variables that belong to a function</font>

```
returnType functionName(varType parameter1, varType parameter2, ...){
    returnType variable = /* Some fancy code */
    /* more code */
    return variable;
}
```
<font color=blue>a function must always be defined before it is called</font>

Pass-by-value is the default mode of operation when it comes to parameters in C++,which means that parameter is passed to function by value,variable is a copy of the variable passed in,changing it inside the function does not change the value in the calling function.

```
defenition:
pass by value:When a parameter is passed into a function, the new variable stores a copy of the passed in value in memory.
pass by reference:When a parameter is passed into a function, the new variable stores a reference to the passed in value, which allows you to directly edit the original value.
```

### When we use references
* To allow helper functions to edit data stuctures in other functions
* To avoid making new copies of large data structures in memory
* References also provide a workaround for multiple return values
    - Your function can both have a return value and also directly edit a Vector object passed in as a parameter.This makes it as if your function is returning both the vector and the actual return value
  
### When we don't use references
* If we always used references,functions would all be able to edit one another's variables, and scoping would get confusing
* When the data itself is small(i.e. the cost of copying by value is low)
* Note: You can't provide a literal as an argument if you are passing a parameter by reference.

## string

* Strings are mutable in C++
* You can add characters to strings and strings to strings using += and +
    - Strings must use double quotes("")while characters use single('')
* You can use logical operators to compare strings(and characters)(only comparing the first letter)

when running 
```
string hiThere = "hi"+"there";
```
you would get <font color=red>a error</font> <br />
cause there are cpp string and c string in cpp,when declare a string like "hi" you would get a c string,which is not allowed to be added together. <br />

when running
```
string hiThere = "hi"+'!';
```
you would get <font color=red>a garbage</font> <br />
cause when add a different type to a c string, it would point to random garbage.

### C strings vs C++ strings summary
* C strings have no methods
    - This is why you can't do something like "hi".length() in C++
* Conversion fixes
    - Store the C string in a variable first to convert it to a C++ string
    - Use a conversion function
      - string("text"); // converts the C string literal into a C++ string
      - strig.c_str(); // return a C string from a C++ string <br />

Takeaway:Beware of C string

## Abstract Data Types

### Vector

* At a high level,a vector is an ordered collection of elements of the same type that can grow and shrink in size.
  - Each element in the collection has a specific location, or index
  - All elements in a vector must be of the same type.Unlike in other programming languages, a single vector cannot contain elements of mixed types.
  - Vectors are fixible when it comes to the number of elements they can store.You can easily add and remove elements from a vector.Vectors also know their size, meaning you can query them to see how many elements they currently contain.

### Grid(In Stanford library)

![grid](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/grid.png)
* A 2D array, defined with a particular width and height
  - we say array instead of vector here because the dimensions are established when the grid is created
* useful for spreadsheets,game boards,etc
* Three ways to declare a grid
  - Grid<type> gridName;
    ```
    Grid<int> board; \\ if you declare a board with no initialization,you must resize it or reassign it before using it.Resizing will fill it with default values for that type.
    board.resize(3,3);
    board[0][0] = 2;
    ```
  - Grid<type> gridName(numRows,numCols);
    ```
    Grid<int> board(3,3);
    ```
  - Grid<type> gridName = {{r0c0,r0c1,r0c2},{r1c0,r1c1,r1c2},...};
    ```
    Grid<int> board = {{2,0},{6,0}};
* We could use a combination of Vectors to simulate a 2D matrix,but a Grid is easier

### Tradeoffs with vectors and grids(vs. other ADTs)
* Easily able to search through all elements
* Can use the indices as a way of structuring the data

### Struct

A way to bundle different types of information in C++,like creating a custom data structure.
* To declare a struct,you can either assign each of its members separately or assign it when it's created

### Queue

* First person In is the First person Out(FIFO)
  - When you remove(dequeue)people from the queue, you remove them from the front of the line
* Last person in is the last person served
  - When you insert(enqueue)people into a queue, you insert them at the back(the end of the line)

### Stack

![stack](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/stack.png)
* Modeled like an actual pancakesü•û
* Only the top element in a stack is accessible
  - The Last item In is the First one Out(LIFO)
* The push, pop, and top operations are the only operations allowed by the stack ADT

Common bugs: <br />
* If you edit the ADT within a loop,don't use .size() in the loop's conditions!The size changes while the loop runs.
* Unlike with queues,you can't iterate over a stack without destroying it

### Tradeoffs with queues and stacks(vs. other ADTs)

* What are some downsides to using a queue/stack?
  - No random access.You get the front/top,or nothing.
  - No side-effect-free traversal -- you can only iterate over all elements in the structure by removing previous elements first.
  - No easy way to search through a queue/stack
* What are some benefits?
  - Useful for lots of problem -- many real-world problems can be solved with either a LIFO or FIFO model
  - Very easy to build one from array such that access is guaranteed to be fast.

### Set

* A set is a collection of elements with no duplicates
* Sets are faster than ordered data structures like vectors -- since there are no duplicate, it's faster for them to find things
* Sets don't have indices

#### Set operands

Sets can be compared,combined,etc.
* s1 == s2 <br/>
  true if the sets contain exactly the same elements
* s1 != s2 <br/>
  true if the sets don't contain the exact same elements
* s1 + s2 <br/>
  returns the union of s1 and s2(i.e.,all elements in both)
* s1 * s2 <br/>
  return the intersection of s1 and s2(i.e.,only the elements in both sets)
* s1 - s2 <br/>
  returns the different of s1 and s2(the elemenets in s1 but not in s2)
