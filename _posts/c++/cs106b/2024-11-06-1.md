惭愧了 这么久才又开始学习

## abstration

### defination

Design that hides the details of how something works while still allowing the user to access complex functionality

### what is an abstraction

Key idea:Through a simpler interface, users are able to take full advantage of a complex system without needing to know how it works or how it was made.

## includes

### angle bracket

use of the angle bracket operators is usually reserved for code from the C++ Standard library

### quote

use of the quotes is usually reserved for code from the Stanford C++ libraries, or code in files that you have written yourself

## variables and types

### variables

A way for code to store information by associating a value with a name  <br />
we will think of a variable as a named container storing a value 

### types

All variables have a type associated with them, where the type describes the representation of the variable. <br />
In C++,all types must be explicitly defined when the variable is created, and a variable cannot change its type.

## funtion

### anatomy of a function

![function](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoshuu/img/Picgo/function.png)

```
definition:
parameter(s):
one or more variables that your function expects as input.

argument(s):
the values passed into your function and assigned to its parameter variables.

return value:
the value that your function hands back to the "calling" function.
```
<font color=blue>can think parameters as a special set of local variables that belong to a function</font>

```
returnType functionName(varType parameter1, varType parameter2, ...){
    returnType variable = /* Some fancy code */
    /* more code */
    return variable;
}
```
<font color=blue>a function must always be defined before it is called</font>

Pass-by-value is the default mode of operation when it comes to parameters in C++,which means that parameter is passed to function by value,variable is a copy of the variable passed in,changing it inside the function does not change the value in the calling function.

## 循环什么的不想记（瘫

## string

* Strings are mutable in C++
* You can add characters to strings and strings to strings using += and +
    - Strings must use double quotes("")while characters use single('')
* You can use logical operators to compare strings(and characters)(only comparing the first letter)

when running 
```
string hiThere = "hi"+"there";
```
you would get <font color=red>a error</font> <br />
cause there are cpp string and c string in cpp,when declare a string like "hi" you would get a c string,which is not allowed to be added together. <br />

when running
```
string hiThere = "hi"+'!';
```
you would get <font color=red>a garbage</font> <br />
cause when add a different type to a c string, it would point to random garbage.

### C strings vs C++ strings summary
* C strings have no methods
    - This is why you can't do something like "hi".length() in C++
* Conversion fixes
    - Store the C string in a variable first to convert it to a C++ string
    - Use a conversion function
      - string("text"); // converts the C string literal into a C++ string
      - strig.c_str(); // return a C string from a C++ string <br />

Takeaway:Beware of C string
