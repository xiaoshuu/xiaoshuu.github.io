## Search Problems

* A search problem consists of:
  * A state space
  * A successor function(with actions, costs)
  * A start state and a goal test
* A solution is a sequence of actions (a plan) which transforms the start state to a goal state
* The world state includes every last detail of the environment.
* A search state keeps only the details needed for planning(abstraction)

```
Problem:Pathing
 States:(x,y)location
 Actions:NSEW
 Successor:update location only
 Goal test:is(x,y) = END

Problem: Eat-All-Dots
 States:{(x,y),dot booleans}
 Actions:NSEW
 Successor:update location and possibly a dot boolean
 Goal test:dots all false
```

### State space graph

A mathematical representation of a search problem
* Nodes are (abstracted) world configurations
* Arcs represent successors(action results)
* The goal test is a set of goal nodes(maybe only one)

In a state space graph, each state occurs only once

### Search Trees

* A "what if" tree of plans and their outcomes
* The start state is the root node
* Children correspond to successors
* Nodes show states, but correspond to PLANS that achieve those states
* For most problems, we can never actually build the whole tree

#### Searching with a Search Tree

* Expand out potential plans(tree nodes)
* Maintain a fringe of partial plans under consideration
* Try to expand as few tree nodes as possible

### DFS

先进后出，扩展最后加入边缘的那个节点

### BFS

先进先出，在边缘等待时间最长的节点会优先被扩展

### Iterative Deepening

### Uniform Cost Search

不再遵循先进后出或先进先出的原则，而是按照当前最小代价进行扩展

Remember:UCS explores increasing cost contours <br/>
The good:UCS is complete and optimal
The bad:
* Explores options in every "direction"
* No information about goal location
